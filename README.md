## RTI CDS Analytics Exercise 02
I was able to perform some exploratory data analysis and I hope you are able to find it useful.  The over theme of the findings are two fold.  Firstly there is evidence that show small craft incidents involving a fatality occur at a substantially higher rate than large craft.  Secondly the aspects that influence the probability of a fatality occurring differ between large and small craft.  For the purposes of this EDA I define large craft as what people would typically fly commercially on e.g. JetBlue.  Small craft are defined as everything else from DIY planes to Helicopters.

Incidents per year have decreased steadily since 1982.  It's unknown whether this is due to the improvement in safety measures or some sort of anomaly in record taking.  Overall injuries and fatalities follow this trend as well with roughly 1 in 10 incidents containing a fatality.

An assumption was made on the missing values in the AirCarrier field and that was that the missing values represented aircraft that didn't belong to an major AirCarrier.  If this assumption holds then fatalities occur in roughly 7% of major Air Carrier incidents.  This is in contrast to the fatalities that occur in 20% of the non major Air Carrier flights.

That said I think it is safe to assume that when fatalities do occur in large carrier planes the number of fatalities per incident are much larger.  For example below is a scatter plot of the Latitudes and Longitudes of incidents containing fatalities.  Size and color both represent the sum of fatalities down weighted by population of the city.

Notice large circles in popular travel destinations like the Carribean and Hawaii.  But look North of NY and you will see a few larger dots one of which represents a crash that occurred in Gander Canada and took the lives of 248 people.

In order to determine some of the reasons flight incidents were more fatal than others I trained a model to predict a binary response of Fatal Incidents and Nonfatal Incidents. I was not interested in using this model to make predictions but rather to gather the feature importance information using Shapley Values.

Above are the feature importances of the model. And while it may take a data scientist to interpret these the main takeaways are this:  Features at the top are most important and the more separated the dots are from the center the stronger the weight that feature will have on the model output.  Notice the colors tend to group together and this is because the color red represents a high value for that feature.  Take a look at the first feature BroadPhaseOfFlight_Landing.  This means, you guessed it, the incident occured during landing.  From this table we are able to gather that being in the landing phase when the incident occurs is our strongest indication for there being NO Fatalities.  If this surprises you and you want to see a deeper analysis into shapley values see the jupyter notebook EDA.ipynb.  While this held true for most planes the relationship was inverted for blimps, helicopters and gliders.  DIY built planes were also a feature that had a strong push toward the incident involving fatalities.

Finally, analysis of the narrative and probable_cause fields were informative.  Probable causes of fatal incidents included examples like suicide, colliding with mountains, ground or water.  For non-fatal incidents collisions occurred with unknown objects, deer, animals, powerlines, and a horse.  Collisions with birds occurred both in fatal and non-fatal incidents.

To address peoples' fear of flying.  Fatal incidents rarely occurred during landing in typical planes, which tends to be the most frightening part of flying.  The opposite is true for balloon aircrafts and DIY aircraft. Turns out most gyrocrafts are built by amateurs.  Incidents that occur while taxiing are generally nonfatal although not exclusively.  For incidents that occurred while taxiing important terms extracted included fire, fueling issues, and collision with vehicles on the runway.
